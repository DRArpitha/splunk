# Line merging settings
########

# The following example linemerges source data into multi-line events for apache_error sourcetype.

[apache_error]
SHOULD_LINEMERGE = True



########
# Settings for tuning
########

# The following example limits the amount of characters indexed per event from host::small_events.

[host::small_events]
TRUNCATE = 256

# The following example turns off DATETIME_CONFIG (which can speed up indexing) from any path
# that ends in /mylogs/*.log.

[source::.../mylogs/*.log]
DATETIME_CONFIG = NONE


  
########
# Timestamp extraction configuration
########

# The following example sets Eastern Time Zone if host matches nyc*.

[host::nyc*]
TZ = US/Eastern


# The following example uses a custom datetime.xml that has been created and placed in a custom app
# directory. This sets all events coming in from hosts starting with dharma to use this custom file.

[host::dharma*]
DATETIME_CONFIG = <etc/apps/custom_time/datetime.xml>



########
# Transform configuration
########

# The following example creates a search field for host::foo if tied to a stanza in transforms.conf.

[host::foo]
TRANSFORMS-foo=foobar

# The following example creates an extracted field for sourcetype access_combined
# if tied to a stanza in transforms.conf.

[eventtype::my_custom_eventtype]
REPORT-baz = foobaz


# The following stanza extracts an ip address from _raw
[my_sourcetype]
EXTRACT-extract_ip = (?<ip>\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3})

# The following example shows how to configure lookup tables
[my_lookuptype]
LOOKUP-foo = mylookuptable userid AS myuserid OUTPUT username AS myusername

# The following shows how to specify field aliases
FIELDALIAS-foo = user AS myuser id AS myid


########
# Sourcetype configuration
########

# The following example sets a sourcetype for the file web_access.log for a unix path.

[source::.../web_access.log]
sourcetype = splunk_web_access 

# The following example sets a sourcetype for the Windows file iis6.log.  Note: Backslashes within Windows file paths must be escaped.

[source::...\\iis\\iis6.log]
sourcetype = iis_access

# The following example untars syslog events.

[syslog]
invalid_cause = archive
unarchive_cmd = gzip -cd -
	

# The following example learns a custom sourcetype and limits the range between different examples
# with a smaller than default maxDist.

[custom_sourcetype]
LEARN_MODEL = true
maxDist = 30


# rule:: and delayedrule:: configuration
# The following examples create sourectype rules for custom sourcetypes with regex.


[rule::bar_some]
sourcetype = source_with_lots_of_bars
MORE_THAN_80 = ----


[delayedrule::baz_some]
sourcetype = my_sourcetype
LESS_THAN_70 = ####

# File configuration
########

# Binary file configuration
# The following example eats binary files from the host::sourcecode.

[host::sourcecode]
NO_BINARY_CHECK = true 
    

# File checksum configuration
# The following example checks the entirety of every file in the web_access dir rather than 
# skipping files that appear to be the same.

[source::.../web_access/*]
CHECK_METHOD = entire_md5
